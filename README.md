_cayce_

Edgar Cayce was also an American clairvoyant who would channel a "source" and answer questions on a wide range of subjects. My source is the SEC's EDGAR database, and my subjects are all publicly held US corporations.

This may eventually be extended to extract holdings information from US Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds.
